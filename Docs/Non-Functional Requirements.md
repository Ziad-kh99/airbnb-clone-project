# Non-Functional/Business Requirements:

## 1. Scalability:
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

## 2. Security:
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

## 3. Performance Optimization:
- Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

## 4. Testing:
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest.
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
